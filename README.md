# DC Income Workforce Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes publicly available District of Columbia employee income data to examine patterns in compensation, tenure, and employment type. The goal was to explore how long-term employment relates to pay levels and to assess differences between temporary, term, and regular employees.

### Key Questions
- How does employee tenure relate to annual salary?
- Are temporary or term employees compensated differently than long-term employees?
- How do compensation ratios vary across employee types?
- What role do outliers and non–full-year employees play in income analysis?

### Data & Methods
Data Source: Public DC employee income records
Tools Used: SQL, Tableau

### Key Techniques:
- Data cleaning and filtering (removal of temporary employees and unrealistic salary values)
- Tenure calculation from hire dates
- Compensation ratio analysis
- Aggregation and comparison across employee categories

### Key Findings
- Long-term employees tend to exhibit more stable compensation patterns.
- Temporary employees significantly skew salary distributions and were excluded from tenure-based analyses.
