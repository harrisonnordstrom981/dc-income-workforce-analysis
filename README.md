# DC Income Workforce Analysis

###Project Overview
This project analyzes publicly available District of Columbia employee income data to examine patterns in compensation, tenure, and employment type. The goal was to explore how long-term employment relates to pay levels and to assess differences between temporary, term, and regular employees.

### Key Questions
1] How does employee tenure relate to annual salary?
2] Are temporary or term employees compensated differently than long-term employees?
3] How do compensation ratios vary across employee types?
4] What role do outliers and non–full-year employees play in income analysis?

Data & Methods
Data Source: Public DC employee income records
Tools Used: BigQuery (SQL), Tableau

##Key Techniques:
Data cleaning and filtering (removal of temporary employees and unrealistic salary values)
Tenure calculation from hire dates
Compensation ratio analysis
Aggregation and comparison across employee categories

## Key Findings
Long-term employees tend to exhibit more stable compensation patterns.
Temporary employees significantly skew salary distributions and were excluded from tenure-based analyses.

Compensation ratios provide clearer insight into pay equity than raw salary alone.

Visualizations

Visualizations were created in Tableau to explore salary distributions, tenure–pay relationships, and differences across employee types.
